Haskell clone of my original board game formerly called Turtle Melee.
The original is here: https://sourceforge.net/p/turtlemelee/ I am the author of both

As well as reimplementing in Haskell, I intend to add these features:
- A 3 player version
- A neural network evaluation function
- A save format, maybe using arithmetic coding.
